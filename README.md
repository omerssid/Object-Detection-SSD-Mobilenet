# Object Detection using SSD Mobilenet and Tensorflow Object Detection API
This repository contains code for implementing object detection using the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) algorithm with TensorFlow. SSD is a popular real-time object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy. This implementation is built upon TensorFlow and provides a streamlined way to perform object detection on your own datasets or pre-trained models.

## SSD MobileNet Architecture
The SSD architecture is a single convolution network that learns to predict bounding box locations and classify these locations in one pass. Hence, SSD can be trained end-to-end. The SSD network consists of base architecture (MobileNet in this case) followed by several convolution layers

By using SSD, we only need to take one single shot to detect multiple objects within the image, while regional proposal network (RPN) based approaches such as R-CNN series that need two shots, one for generating region proposals, one for detecting the object of each proposal. Thus, SSD is much faster compared with two-shot RPN-based approaches.
